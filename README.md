# Dictionary
My first python project 
we have dictionary , client and server .
the server is update his own dictionary when the client update/change is own dictionary .
the client use dictionary normally like : my_dcit['0'] = "nothing" , while the server update is on background .
the server dictionary is the most update all time .
